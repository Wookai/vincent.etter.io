                <p>
                    The dataset used in this paper has three data files: vote results, vote features, and region features.
                    We give more details about each file below.
                </p>
                <h4>Vote results</h4>
                <p>
                    The first file <code>todo.txt</code> contains the outcome of 281 nationwide votes that took place in Switzerland between January 1981 and December 2014.
                    For each vote, we record the result (proportion of <em>yes</em>) in every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Switzerland" target="_blank">Swiss municipalities</a> (municipalities are the smallest government division in Switzerland).
                    The raw data can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/17/03/blank/data/01.html" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Statistical Office</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In December 2014, there were 2352 municipalities in Switzerland.
                    However, because of administrative fusions and divisions, the regions change over time.
                    To have a complete dataset over the 34 years spanned by the votes, we used a fixed set of regions (the ones exisiting in December 2014) and interpolated the result of regions that did not exist at some point in time.
                    To compute the interpolated result of a region at a given time, we simply kept track all the fusions and divisions, took all regions existing at the time of the vote that have a part in the missing region, and computed the average of their results, weighted by their population.
                    To have more details about the interpolation procedure, please refer to Section 5.2.1 of <a href="../publications/etter2015thesis.pdf" target="_blank">this thesis</a>.
                </p>
                <h4>Vote features</h4>
                <p>
                    TODO
                </p>
                <h4>Region features</h4>
                <p>
                    Each region is characterized by 25 features: location, elevation, demographic attributes, political profile, and languages spoken.
                    The data was obtained directly from the <a href="http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/regionen/02/daten.html" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Statistical Office</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We summarize below the features and their main statistics.
                    The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates are defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_coordinate_system" target="_blank">Swiss coordinate system</a>.
                    The election features correspond to the proportion of votes for each of the main political parties during the national elections of 2011.

    We consider online predictions of vote results,
where regions across a country vote on an issue under
discussion. Such online predictions before and during the day
of the vote are useful to media agencies, polling institutes,
and political parties, e.g., to identify regions that are crucial
in determining the national outcome of a vote. We analyze
a unique dataset from Switzerland. The dataset contains 281
votes from 2352 regions over a period of 34 years. We make
several contributions towards improving online predictions.
First, we show that these votes exhibit a bi-clustering of the vote
results, i.e., regions that are spatially close tend to vote similarly,
and issues that discuss similar topics show similar global
voting patterns. Second, we develop models that can exploit
this bi-clustering, as well as the features associated with the
votes and regions. Third, we show that, when combining vote
results and features together, Bayesian methods are essential to
obtaining good performance. Our results show that Bayesian
methods give better estimates of the hyperparameters than
non-Bayesian methods such as cross-validation. The resulting
models generalize well to many different tasks, produce robust
predictions, and are easily interpretable.
